# 🐷 Pig Game

This is a simple 2-player **Pig Dice Game** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to be the first player to reach **20 points**. On your turn, roll the dice as many times as you like to build up your score — but if you roll a **1**, you lose all points from that turn!

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Two-player turn-based gameplay
- Rolling the dice and accumulating current score
- Holding the score to add it to the global score
- Switching turns when a 1 is rolled or "Hold" is clicked
- Visual feedback for active player and winner
- "New Game" button to restart the game

   - If it's not 1, the number is added to the current turn's score.
   - If it's 1, the player loses their turn and score resets for the round.
4. Click **"📥 Hold"** to save your current score and pass the turn.
5. First player to reach **20 points** wins.
6. Click **"🔄 New Game"** to play again.
